# GlobalEffects

This is a simple plugin to globally apply stacking effects to players.
Effectively this modifies the potency of all the effects to give a global increase or decrease to player stats.
Effect modifications are applied at all times and stack onto other sources such as potions and beacons.
The plugin can also reduce the potency of those other sources with negative modifiers, but there are no negative effects.

Modifications are done by increasing or decreasing the level of the effect.

## Configuration options
- Select which worlds effects are applied
- Change effect modifier on a per-effect basis

## Install
1. Drop the `.jar` file into your `plugins` folder.
